#Caseware
The caseware for the `basic-handheld-turbidimeter` is provided as an SVG file and a FreeCAD python macro (FCMacro) -- the first file may be viewed and edited in many vector graphics programs (e.g. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)), and the latter in [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/).  
  
This case is designed for 0.25"-thick acryllic; suitable alternative materials exist. It is recommended that the case be cut from an opaque material to prevent background light leakage onto the turbidity sensor (though can be programmed to compensate for this to an extent), with the exception of the `case_top_cover` piece (bottom left in the SVG layout) which should be cut from a clear material so that the LED display underneath it is visible to the user.
